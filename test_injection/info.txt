This directory contains an example of how to import the student's code dynamically
and use it with our own simulation environment. 

1. main.py contains a basic example of how to load the user's class

2. testexe.py is the example class that main.py uses for demonstration purposes. 
    The user has to manually enter the path of this file. It is not imported 
    explicitly in main.py. 

3. testagent.py contains an extremely simplified version of what the student's 
    solver must look like. The student's solver must contain a def nextMove(self) function
    that returns a string. 

4. testgame.py is an example of the testagent.py and the simulator/game.py class working together. 
    We have written an observer object that matches the api declared in simulator/observer.py, and 
    we are using it to pass information from our simulator class. We have also added a 
    def getLatestMove(self) function so that we can get the latest move from the student's 
    Agent.
